# s_rocks_assignment_project


The assignment was simple but did challenged my develpoment abilities a bit.

I used MVVM + Clean Arch. for development as the task was really simple and didn't require to create heavy Repositories to fetch data

Used Firestore to keep all 4 the Services(as asked to) and everytime app is restarted this data is loaded from firestore and the background images are uploaded to G-drive  





(appologies for missing the deadline by 2 hours)
